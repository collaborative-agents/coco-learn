Coco continuously observes your screen to offer proactive help, so its data
flows require particular care. In a standalone configuration, processing and
storage can remain local except for requests to the VLM/LLM provider selected
by the operator. A study or organizational deployment may additionally enable
a Gateway and hosted Router, as the current pilot does.

This document details, for each component, what data flows in and out, exactly what is sent to the model provider, and every file Coco writes to disk.


## Components: inputs and outputs

Coco involves three local processes that talk to each other over `localhost`:

### Desktop app (Electron)

The avatar and chat UI.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Input** | Observation events streamed from the sensing service (SSE); guidance returned by the tutor service; your chat messages, feedback clicks, and settings. |
| **Output** | Forwards observation text and your chat messages to the tutor service; writes settings, memory, and activity history to the local user-data folder (see [footprint](#on-disk-footprint)). |
| **Network** | Local services use loopback. Clicking "Open ChatGPT / Claude / …" opens the tool with nothing attached — the generated prompt is only copied to your clipboard. The clipboard is written only when you click copy, and read only when you paste into Coco's chat. Configured deployments may also send model requests to a Router/provider and chat/session records to a Gateway. |

### Sensing service (`lib/sensing`)

The observer. Implements the Computer Use Behavior Observation Protocol.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Input** | Screen frames (~5 fps, downscaled JPEGs with the cursor highlighted); mouse click/scroll events and key presses (used locally to segment activity into meaningful moments).|
| **Output** | Calls the **observer VLM** when a trigger fires (periodic snapshot, idle/struggle detection, or your chat message) — see [What is sent to the VLM](#what-is-sent-to-the-vlm). Emits the resulting observation text to the desktop app over a local event stream. |
| **Storage** | Screenshots are deleted the moment the observer has read them. Per-session action log in a local SQLite database (deleted with the session folder). |

### Tutor service (`lib/proactive_tutor`)

The helper. Diagnoses each observation and decides whether to offer a hint, nudge, or delegation prompt.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Input** | Observation text from the sensing service (relayed by the desktop app), your chat messages, relevant propositions retrieved from local episodic memory, and your context settings (scenario, AI tools, memory). |
| **Output** | Calls the **tutor LLM** with a *text-only* prompt — observation, conversation history, relevant retrieved propositions, and memory. Images are included **only** when you explicitly attach a screenshot (hotkey capture or paste into chat). Returns guidance text to the desktop app. Optional visualizations are rendered by locally executed, safety-checked code. |

## What is sent to the VLM

When the observer triggers, one API request goes to the configured model,
directly or through a Router, containing:

- **The screenshot(s)** — the pixels of your screen at that moment (plus any capture you flagged with the hotkey). This is the sensitive payload: whatever is visible on screen is in the image.
- **Observation context** — the observer's own previous outputs, your Coco memory/problem statement, and conversation history when a chat session is active.

What is deliberately **not** in the request: your keystroke log, click coordinates, window titles, app names, filenames, or anything read from your filesystem. Raw input events are used only locally to decide *when* to observe.

In standalone mode there need not be a CoCo backend, and requests can go
directly to the selected provider. In the current pilot, requests pass through
the hosted CoCo Router and selected chat/session records go to the study
Gateway. **The provider choice still determines where screen pixels are
processed.** See the pilot Data Retention Statement for the Router and Gateway
records, then consult the applicable provider policy. Privacy-preserving
standalone options include:

1. **Self-hosted VLMs** — run an open-weight model on hardware you control via [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), etc. Your screenshots never leave your machine (or your own infrastructure).
2. **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) providers** — open-weight models served from attested secure enclaves, e.g. [Tinfoil](https://tinfoil.sh/), so even the host cannot inspect your data.
3. **[Unlinkable inference](https://openanonymity.ai/blog/unlinkable-inference/)** — relay requests to any model provider while stripping the link between you and your requests, e.g. [Open Anonymity](https://chat.openanonymity.ai/).

All three are selected purely by the model-name prefix in `.env` — see [lib/external_api/README.md](lib/external_api/README.md). We are also working toward an on-device-native Coco that removes remote inference entirely.

## On-disk footprint

CoCo's local files live in the app's user-data folder. Deleting it removes the
local footprint, but does not delete records held by an enabled Gateway,
Router, or model provider:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/coco`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\coco`
- **Linux**: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/coco` or `~/.config/coco`

| File | Format | Contents | Retention |
|---|---|---|---|
| `coco-profile.json` | JSON | Onboarding settings: scenario, your AI-tool list, custom observer prompt | Until you change or delete it |
| `coco-memory.txt` | Plain text | Coco's long-term memory about you — free text you can view and edit in-app | Until you edit or clear it |
| `activity-history.jsonl` | JSON Lines: observation summaries plus proactive-support engagement and revealed support content | Timeline shown in the activity view, including whether you opened an offered support and the content needed to revisit it | **Auto-pruned to 30 days** |
| `chat-conversations.json` | JSON | Chat transcripts, including pasted images, shown by the chat panel's conversation-history button | Stored locally without an automatic conversation-count limit |
| `memory/memory.db` | SQLite with FTS5 | Semantic observer outputs, GUM-style propositions inferred from them, and links to supporting observations. Queried locally to add relevant past context to tutor prompts. | Until you delete the database |
| `custom_prompts/observer.txt` | Plain text | Your custom observer prompt, if you set one | Until you change it |
| `coco-records/session_<ts>/` | Folder per session | See below | Until you delete the folder |

Each session folder under `coco-records/` contains:

| File | Format | Contents | Retention |
|---|---|---|---|
| `actions.db` | SQLite, one table `observations` `(id, observer_name, content, content_type, created_at, updated_at)` | Raw action strings the segmenter uses — key presses, clicks, scrolls. **Local only, never sent to any model.** | Lives with the session folder |
| `screenshots/` | JPEG | Rolling capture buffer | **Deleted as soon as the observer reads them** — nothing accumulates |
| `hotkey_captures/` | JPEG | Screenshots you explicitly flagged with `Cmd+Shift+Space` | Until you remove them in-app or delete the folder |
| `observations.jsonl` | JSON Lines | Observer inputs (text prompt) and outputs per call | Lives with the session folder |
| `tutor_calls.jsonl` | JSON Lines | Tutor prompts and returned guidance | Lives with the session folder |
| `feedback.jsonl` | JSON Lines | Your 👍/👎 reactions to suggestions | Lives with the session folder |
| `observer_screenshots/` | JPEG | **Only if you opt in** with `COLLECT_TRAINING_SCREENSHOTS=1`: copies of the exact images sent to the VLM, kept for your own training use. Off by default. | Until you delete them |

Service logs are written next to the desktop app (`desktop/logs/*.log`) for debugging; they can contain observation and guidance text, so treat them like the records above. In standalone/developer setups, provider credentials may be read from the local `.env`. The current pilot instead uses a study-managed Router and does not ask participants for a personal provider key.
